My attempt at using the Twitter API using tweepy. Kindness Bot searches the Greater Nashville area for uncivil tweets and reminds users to be kind online.

There are also modules to auto-reply to new followers, tweet on a schedule, and monitor rate limits.

Requires a module called credentials.py with the following info from Twitter.

consumer_key = [consumer_key]  
consumer_secret = [consumer_secret]   
access_token = [access_token]  
access_token_secret = [access_token_secret]
